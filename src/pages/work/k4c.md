For the past two summers, I have worked as a programming instructor at Kids4Coding, a summer STEM camp for students for ages 7-16. I worked for ~40 hours weeks for ~7 weeks each summer. Through this experience I got to work with bright kids of all types and help share my love of STEM with them. My communications skills were well tested as high level concepts needed to be simplified to teach a young audience and manage behavior, but it was an amazing experience and help motivate me to learn myself. Working there in 2018 inspired me to learn how to program and by the time I worked there in 2018, I had already written numerous AI and deep network to do a variety of tasks and compete in Kaggle programming competitions.
