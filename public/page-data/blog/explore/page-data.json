However, this problem is not limits just to AI. It can be generalized to anything from college applications, governments, and your dinner. To explain how it works, let us consider the agent. An agent can be thought of as a thing that can move, has goals, and can take actions to achieve its goal. For example, when you are at a restaurant and want something good to eat for dinner, you are an agent. You can make choices, what you order to eat, and you have a goal, get a delicious meal. Now you have a choice. You can either try a new item on the menu, explore, or choose your favorite meal, exploit. If you just exploit and never try something new, you may miss out on years of enjoying a far tastier meal, but if you always try something new, you could be eating terrible meals instead of ones you know you like. So which should you do? </p>\n<p>The answer is a bit of both. In deep learning, networks tend to move fairly random at the start when they don’t fully understand the environment. As they learn more and more, they generally exploit more and more in ways they think will help them best. This should make sense since if a new Thai-India-Swedish fusion restaurant opened up, you probably wouldn’t know the food that well, so you are basically ordering randomly. However, as you go there more and learn what you like, you will start to pick out what you like more. However, it is never good to fully settle in a pattern. In our restaurant example, this is represented by the days you get a hankering to try something new. Deep learning replicates this by always having a low chance of making a random move. Thus, every so often, the network will try something new. With this balance, AI has been able to do incredible accomplishments and master a plethora of complex environments. </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Exploration vs Exploitation"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/blog/explore/"}}}
