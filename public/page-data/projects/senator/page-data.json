To do this, we can look at the voting record and compare how similar Senators are by using dot products. A dot product is a type of multiplication of vectors that outputs a number that correlates to how similar the vectors. To compute a dot product, we use the example of the two vectors [1, 2, 0] and [-1, 3, 4]. First, multiply each corresponding number in each vector; then, we sum the results. So the dot product of [1, 2, 0] and [-1, 3 ,4] is 1<em>-1+2</em>3+0*4=5. If we look at voting records for Senator Johnson and Senator Akaka, for a series of 4 votes Akaka voted yes, no, no, and yes, and Johnson voted yes, yes, no, and yes. We can write these votes as two vectors with 4 dimensions. If we say 1 means yes and -1 means no, our vectors would be [1,-1,-1,1] for Akaka and [1,1,-1,1] for Johnson. The dot product of these would be 2 which means they are fairly similar. This makes sense since they only disagree by a single vote. On the other hand, if we look at Senator Warner and Senator Snow, Warner voted yes, yes, no, and no and Snow voted for no, no, yes, yes. To compare them we would take the dot product of [1, 1, -1, -1] and [-1, -1, 1, 1] and get -4. This is a highly negative number, so these senators are very dissimilar. Furthermore, we can take the average votes of a group of senators, such as a party and compare them to individual Senators. </p>\n<p>These graphs are made a Python script I wrote that computed the dot products of each Senator to the average Republican, Democrat, and all Senators.</p>\n<p>From the comparison of how Republican the Senators are, we can see that, as expected, most Republicans vote with the rest of their party while Democrats tend to support Republican bills far less. However, it is interesting to note that there are some Democrats who vote extremely Republican. This could be Democrats in red states who are showing their constituency that he or she supports their values. Also, Senator Feingold of WI was by far and away the biggest outlier as he was staunchly anti-Republican.</p>\n<p>When comparing to the average Democrat, we see the reverse which is no surprise. However, it can clearly be seen that Republicans vote in concordance with their party more than Democrats do. The average Republican had a likeness of 1974.7 and Democrats had a significantly lower likeness of 1327.6 when compared with members of their own parties. In fact, the average Democrat was almost as similar to Republicans with a score of 1159.5 then with themselves with a score only 12% higher. However, this can be attributed to the fact that the Republicans had the majority in the Senate. Since the majority party controls what bills are voted on, easy, uncontroversial Republicans bills were put on the floor. and bills that could split the party were avoided. This would help unify the Republicans while the Democrats were left to vote on bipartisan bills which are far more controversial and tend to split parties more.</p>\n<p>This realization can help us understand the final graph which compares Senators votes to the average Senatorial vote. In this graph, Republicans share a greater similarity to the norm when compared to Democrats because most of the bills were Republican bills, so they work much more in unison then Democrats.</p>\n<p>In further research, I plan on computing more of these charts to see the characteristics of these parties and how they change over time.</p>\n<p>Source of raw data is  <a href=\"http://resources.codingthematrix.com/\">http://resources.codingthematrix.com/</a> </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"How Extreme is Your Senator?"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/projects/senator/"}}}
